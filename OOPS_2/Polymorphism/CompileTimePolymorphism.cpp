// Function Overloading : When there are multiple functions in a class with the same name but different parameters, these functions are overloaded. The main advantage of function overloading is that it increases the programâ€™s readability. Functions can be overloaded by using different numbers of arguments or by using different types of arguments.

// Operator Overloading : Operator overloading is a feature in C++ that allows you to redefine the behavior of operators when they are used with objects of your own classes. This feature enables you to make your classes more expressive and intuitive, mimicking the behavior of built-in types.

/*

    Points to remember while overloading an operator:

    -> It can be used only for user-defined operators(objects, structures) but cannot be used for in-built operators(int, char, float, etc.).

    -> Operators = and & are already overloaded in C++ to avoid overloading them.

    -> The precedence and associativity of operators remain intact.
