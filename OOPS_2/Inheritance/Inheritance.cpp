/*
    Inheritance :
     Inheritance in C++ is a mechanism where a class (called a derived class or subclass) inherits properties and behaviors (data members and member functions) from another class (called a base class or superclass). This allows for code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.


     // Syntax: In C++, the syntax for inheritance is:

    class BaseClass
    {
    // Base class members
    };

    class DerivedClass : access - specifier BaseClass
    {
    // Derived class members
    };


    Modes of Inheritance :-


   -> Public mode: If we derive a subclass from a public base class. Then, the base classâ€™s public members will become public in the derived class, and protected class members will become protected in the derived class.


   -> Protected mode: If we derive a subclass from a Protected base class. Then both public members and protected  members of the base class will become protected in the derived class.


   -> Private mode: If we derive a subclass from a Private base class. Then both public members and protected members of the base class will become Private in the derived class.
