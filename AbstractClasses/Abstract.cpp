/*

    Abstract classes canâ€™t be instantiated, i.e., we cannot create an object of this class. However, we can derive a class from it and instantiate the object of the derived class. An Abstract class has at least one pure virtual function.



                        Properties of the abstract classes:

    -> It can have normal functions and variables along with pure virtual functions.

    -> Prominently used for upcasting(converting a derived-class reference or pointer to a base-class. In other words, upcasting allows us to treat a derived type as a base type), so its derived classes can use its interface.

    -> If an abstract class has a derived class, they must implement all pure virtual functions, or they will become abstract.



    If we do not override the pure virtual function in the derived class, then the derived class also becomes an abstract class.

    We cannot create objects of an abstract class. However, we can derive classes from them and use their data members and member functions (except pure virtual functions).
